# Urban Insight

## Direct

Urban Insight is a GIS-powered web platform that visualizes sustainability and accessibility gaps across cities — helping planners and citizens make data-driven urban decisions.

## Simple

We make city data easy to see by turning complex maps and datasets into clear, interactive visuals anyone can explore.

## Valuable

Our platform helps governments plan smarter, residents understand their city better, and communities become safer, more inclusive, and more resilient to climate risks.

## Validated

Built using real Calgary open data and GIS analysis from our geomatics teammate, our prototype already maps flood-risk zones and accessibility coverage showing clear insight into where cities can improve.

## How to run locally

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (recommended v16+ or newer)
- npm (bundled with Node)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This project uses Vite + React + Tailwind. The `dev` script runs the Vite development server. You can also build and preview the production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Project layout highlights:

- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/` — React source files (e.g. `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`)
- `vite.config.js` and `tailwindcss` are already configured

If you hit issues, make sure your Node version is up to date and try removing `node_modules` and reinstalling.
